## Summary of Claude Code Features

### Managing Project Memory

- **/init**: Claude Code scans your codebase and creates CLAUDE.md file inside your project directory.
  - CLAUDE.md guides Claude through your codebase, pointing out important commands, architecture and coding style. It's automatically included in the context each time you launch Claude Code.
  - Here's an example of a CLAUDE.md file generated by init for the RAG chatbot example.
- **#**: Use # to quickly add a memory. Useful when you see Claude Code repeats an error.
  - Example 1: since the project is a uv project, we added these to CLAUDE.md file using #:

    ```bash
    #use uv to run python files or add any dependencies
    ```

  - Example 2: you can inform Claude Code about the database schema, in this case since you have a vector database, you can inform Claude Code about the collections stored in the vector database:

    ```yaml
    #The vector database has two collections:
    course_catalog:
      stores course titles for name resolution
      metadata for each course: title, instructor, course_link, lesson_count, lessons_json (list of lessons: lesson_number, lesson_title, lesson_link)
    course_content:
      stores text chunks for semantic search
      metadata for each chunk: course_title, lesson_number, chunk_index
    ```

### Summary of Claude Code Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/clear` | clears current conversation history |
| `/compact` | summarizes current conversation history |
| `ESC` | interrupt Claude to redirect or correct it |
| `ESC ESC` | rewind the conversation to an earlier point in time |
| `@` | Mention files with @ to include its content in your request |
| `/mcp` | Manage MCP connection & check available MCP servers with their provided tools (MCP with Claude Code) |

You can use regular bash command within Claude Code, but you need to start the command with ! (for example: !pwd). You can type exit to quit Claude Code.

### Shortcuts

| Shortcuts | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| shift+tab | switch between planning and auto-accept mode |
| cmd+ shift+ ctrl + 4 (Mac) or Win + Shift + S (Windows) | take a screenshot |
| Ctrl + V | paste a screenshot (might not work on Windows) |

### Additional Claude Features

#### Extended Thinking Mode

For complex tasks (e.g., complex architectural changes, debugging complicated issues), you can use the word "think" to trigger extended thinking mode. There are several levels of thinking: "think" < "think hard" < "think harder" < "ultrathink." Each level allocates more thinking budget for Claude.

#### Use of subagents

You've learned that one of the out-of-the-box tools for Claude Code is Task, which Claude Code can use to launch subagents for complex multi-step tasks. You can explicitly ask Claude Code to use subagents to brainstorm ideas or to investigate multiple aspects of a question or a problem you want to solve. These built-in agents are of general purpose.

You can also create your customized specialized subagents. Each subagent has its own context window, and you can define a custom system prompt and specific tools for each subagent. This part is not covered in this course, but you can check the details in the documentation here.
