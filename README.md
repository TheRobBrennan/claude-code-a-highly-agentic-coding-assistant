# Claude Code: A Highly Agentic Coding Assistant

This repository contains my work for the DeepLearning.AI short course: [Claude Code: A Highly Agentic Coding Assistant](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/claude-code-a-highly-agentic-coding-assistant/).

## About This Course

In this course, I'll learn how to use Claude Code, a highly agentic AI coding assistant that can help developers build software more efficiently. The course covers how to leverage Claude Code's capabilities for various coding tasks, from simple code generation to complex project development.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Familiarity with version control (Git)
- Node.js and npm installed
- Access to the DeepLearning.AI course materials

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/claude-code-a-highly-agentic-coding-assistant.git
   cd claude-code-a-highly-agentic-coding-assistant
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Follow along with the course materials and complete the exercises.

## Available Scripts

The following npm scripts are available in this project:

```bash
